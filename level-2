1.Automate backups with Cron


#!/bin/bash

SOURCE=/opt/devproject

BACKUP=/backup/devproject_$(date +%F).tar.gz

sudo tar -czvf $BACKUP $SOURCE

echo "Backup stored at $BACKUP"


2.Create shell scripts: Log cleanup, service restart, health checks


#!/bin/bash

find /var/log -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;

echo "Old logs cleared"


 3.Manage logs under /var/log

#!/bin/bash

SERVICES="nginx ssh"

for svc in $SERVICES; do

    sudo systemctl is-active --quiet $svc && \

    echo "$svc is running" || \

    echo "$svc is down"

done

4.Monitor system performance and troubleshoot services


#!/bin/bash

echo "---CPU Load---"; top -b -n1 | head -5

echo "---Disk Space---"; df -h

echo "---Memory---"; free -h
